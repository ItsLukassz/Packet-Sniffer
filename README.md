# Packet sniffer

This project is still work in progress


#### Why am I making another one of those sniffers?

Well, this isn't intended for public use, as this is a personal project to learn how to use jframes and networking in java

This project might be abandoned at any time


# Progress

### Next Step:

Figuring out how to catch outgoing and incoming packets and display them in the gui or creating a .txt file

### Changelog
##### (Order is from top to bottom since I can't be bothered to add version)
Added a check to see if entered number is actually a number

Changed the design of the gui

Created a starting GUI
